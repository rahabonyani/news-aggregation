      "The Wall Street rally to start 2024 seems to be slowing down in the last week of the first quarter. Stocks were mostly flat Tuesday, with all three major market indexes either even slightly in the red.\n\nThe S&P 500 was down about 0.1% shortly before markets closed, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average was even and the Nasdaq was off 0.2%.\n\nInvestors were waiting next for the GameStop to report earnings after the bell. GameStop stock, the most famous “meme stock” on Wall Street, surged Monday but was down slightly on Tuesday.\n\nHere’s what else is happening in the markets.\n\nAfter weeks of under performance that saw it trail its “Magnificent Seven” tech rivals at or near the bottom of the S&P 500, Tesla stock was up as much as 6% on Tuesday. The rise came after Elon Musk required employees of the electric vehicle maker to install and show customers how to use his company’s Full Self-Driving (FSD) driver assistance system before finalizing any deliveries in North America. He also said all U.S. cars capable of using FSD will have the system enabled for a one-month trial.\n\nTesla stock had given back some of those gains to trade up 3.3% shortly before markets closed.\n\nMcCormick & Co. stock rallied more than 10% after the spice maker reported a 3% increase in sales from a year ago. The company’s revenue exceeded the estimate from $1.55 billion to $1.6 billion.\n\nReddit hits a new all-time high in just its second week\n\nReddit, which enjoyed a successful IPO last week, surged another 15% on Tuesday as options trading started and investors poured money into the newly listed company. Reddit stock was up about 11.5% shortly before markets closed.\n\nAt its annual investor day, shipping giant UPS increased its revenue target for 2026, to between $108 billion and $114 billion. But it warned investors that the current quarter will be the “toughest” of the year and that profits will fall by 40%.\n\nUPS stock was down 8% shortly before markets closed.\n\nAmid the record inflows for spot Bitcoin ETFs, Bitcoin surged past $71,000 and close to its all-time high of $73,000. But it fell below $70,000 later in the afternoon. An executive with investing giant BlackRock recently said Bitcoin won’t be as volatile as it used to be, as cryptocurrencies becomes more mature and institutionalized.\n\nEther was trading at $3,500 late in the day, and Dogecoin was at $0.17.",

      "OAKLAND — Robert F. Kennedy Jr. brings his longshot bid for the White House to the Bay Area Tuesday and is expected to announce Oakland native and Silicon Valley lawyer Nicole Shanahan as his running mate for his independent presidential campaign.\n\nSpeculation has swirled in recent weeks about who’d get the nod to join Kennedy, the son of the late Massachusetts U.S. Senator and Attorney General who was assassinated in Los Angeles while campaigning for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1968.\n\nMany political oddsmakers believed it would be Shanahan, a lawyer and mega-donor with Silicon Valley connections as the ex-wife of Google co-founder Sergey Brin. The 38-year-old has no political experience but helped fund an RFK Jr. Super Bowl ad that riffed on a famous 1960 ad for his uncle John F. Kennedy’s presidential campaign. But Shanahan may best be known for a relationship with Elon Musk that led to her divorce from Brin and severed his relationship with the Tesla founder.\n\nKennedy used the build up to his vice presidential pick to spark attention around a campaign largely built around his opposition to vaccines. Top contenders included NFL star quarterback Aaron Rodgers, known to share Kennedy’s vaccine criticisms, former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, former Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and tech entrepreneur Andrew Yang.\n\nKennedy campaign spokesperson Stefanie Spear said the vice presidential announcement allows Kennedy to begin collecting signatures in 20 states that require a vice presidential candidate to qualify the ticket for the ballot. They have been gathering signatures in 16 states.\n\nInside the Kaiser Center auditorium a pair of musicians with a Fender guitar and electric keyboard played rock music while vintage black-and-white photos of Robert F. Kennedy and color nature shots flashed on two large screens flanking the stage. Kennedy’s wife, “Curb Your Enthusiasm” actress Cheryl Hines, introduced him to the crowd.\n\nAmong the gathering wearing a Kennedy 2024 button and ballcap was Joanie Jones. The 70-year-old Richmond woman said she didn’t vote for either Joe Biden or Donald Trump in the 2020 election, “because I was so disgusted” by the choices. But Kennedy won her over with his commitment to “medical freedom,” including not forcing people to get vaccinated.\n\n“That’s all he had to do to get my vote,” said Jones, who said she remembers Kennedy’s father and uncle from her childhood and suspects the government had something to do with their deaths, but that Kennedy is carrying on their tradition. “He’s the freedom candidate,” Jones said.\n\nOthers in attendance handed out information postcards outlining Kennedy’s vaccine position, a potential political liability for voters looking for an alternative to Trump and Biden.\n\n“I’m not anti-vax,” the postcard quotes Kennedy. “I want safe vaccines, I want robust science. I want independent regulators who aren’t owned by Pharma!”\n\nCheck back for more on this developing story.",

    summary:
      "Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is set to announce Nicole Shanahan, a wealthy Bay Area lawyer and mega-donor, as his running mate for his independent presidential bid in the Bay Area. Shanahan, who has no political experience but helped fund an RFK Jr. Super Bowl ad, is known for her relationship with Elon Musk and her divorce from Sergey Brin led to her split from Brin. The announcement allows Kennedy to begin collecting signatures in 20 states that require a vice presidential candidate to qualify for the ballot. The campaign is largely based on Kennedy's opposition to vaccines.",
